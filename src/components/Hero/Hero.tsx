              Hey <span>👋</span> I’m Aizaz Jamil, a front-end developer
              passionate about crafting seamless, accessible, and human-centered
              digital experiences. With 8+ years of experience, I’ve
              collaborated with companies worldwide—helping teams transform
              ideas into responsive, high-performing web applications that
              balance design and functionality.
            </p>
            <p className="hero__content-description">
              My expertise lies in building clean, scalable front-end
              architectures, implementing design systems, and ensuring every
              product performs beautifully across devices. I’m deeply focused on
              accessibility, performance, and user experience—because great code
              isn’t just about how it’s written, but how it empowers people.
              <br /> <br />I believe front-end development is more than writing
              code—it’s about storytelling through interactions, creating
              intuitive interfaces, and delivering products that feel effortless
              to use. My process is rooted in collaboration, continuous
              learning, and a drive to push boundaries with the latest
              technologies.
